### Hi there 👋, I am Anton Orro!

---

A self-taught Software Developer specialized on Front-End development with the **technologies stack** you can find below 👇.

✅ I strive for perfection on everything I do/produce, driven by a mix of passion, curiosity and a strong work ethic.

🚀 I'm currently looking for my first role in the industry and my goal is to be part of an exciting project and to be surrounded of other developers who I can learn from.
